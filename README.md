## ✨  More about me : <br> 
👋🏽I am an application developper specializing in React.js and Node.js.
<h3>👨🏾🎓My Journey</h3>
During my second year of foreign language studies, an assignment in my IT courses sparked my interest in web development. However, it was only after working at a Japanese ski resort that I began an online JavaScript web course in 2023. 
Through this course, I acquired skills in front-end development (Vanilla JavaScript, React.js) and back-end development (Node.js).<br> 
This enabled me to enroll in an Application Designer and Developer program (admitted) in 2025, where I am further enhancing my skills in design and project management.
I have also explored new technologies such as Angular, TypeScript, Next.js, and Nest.js.
